# Sunrise_Analytics_Project

Gained exposure to Google Cloud, DBeaver, PostgreSQL, and Tableau in a semester to develop a KPI dashboard and comprehensive report using data for a fictional hospital. Implemented ERDs, logical schema, normalization techniques, and basic SQL querying.

## Results
With this analysis, we identified the hospital's most likely client. We also gave several strategies including retention (to reduce the number of cancelled and no-show appointments), insurance partnerships, and improved scheduling for non-assigned patients.
